            <h2> Reflect on this... just an icebreaker!</h2>
             <p>1. Your proudest atypical accomplishment: the time you built an Ikea dresser in an hour flat, your Jenga title, your famous Super Bowl dip.</p>

             <p>2. Your most prized collection. Whether it’s old coins, stamps, shopping bags, or Frank Ocean magazine covers, this is a perfect “fun” fact.</p>
                
             <p>3. Your biggest (nonserious) fear. You don’t want to get too vulnerable here (“My biggest fear is death” may chill the room a bit), but if you’ve got a very specific, less common fear, like chipmunks or being scratched, go with that.</p>
                
             <p> 4. The first job you wanted when you were a little kid.</p>
                
               <p>5. Your high-school superlative. (Unless you won, like, “Most Popular” or “Most Likely to Succeed.” No, thanks! Keep it to yourself!)
                
               <p> 6. Your go-to comfort-binge TV show. Say something like Abbott Elementary, Friends, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and people will be like “Ha, same!” and never think of it again. (Ideal.)</p>
                
                <p>7. Something you were embarrassingly late to realize. Like finding out narwhals are a real animal or that Forrest Gump was actually not based on a true story.</p>
                
              <p>  8. Your celebrity crush. The best options here fit in the “Totally Kind of Hot” category — not universal but niche relatable.</p>
                
               <p> 9. Your best celebrity sighting. Personally, I once saw Lindsay Lohan smoking a cigarette on a stoop in downtown St. Paul!</p>
                
               <p> 10. How many tattoos/piercings you have. This one could be considered a little risqué (like … where are they?), so you’ve got to feel out the office vibe first.</p>
                
               <p> 11. What your last meal on Earth would be.
                
               <p> 12. The trip you most want to take but haven’t yet. (For me, Roswell, New Mexico, for alien reasons.)</p>
                
               <p> 13. An embarrassing piece of trivia from your Spotify or other music-streaming account. Most of the apps create a year in review for you, so you may as well use it.</p>
                
               <p> 14. Your favorite word. (Probably don’t pick one that’s NSFW.)</p>
                
                <p>15. A superstition you have.</p>
